        QZs would be the backbone of FEDRA's rule and act as "bastions" throughout the U.S. They were usually put up <br>
        in already existing cities such as Boston or Pittsburgh. These cities provided shelter <br>
        and relative safety to the civilians their as well as a base of operation for FEDRA. <br>
