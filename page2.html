<p class="center"> FEDRA's authoritarian grip on the country would not go unchallenged.Groups such as the WLF (Washington liberation front) <br>
    would pop up across the country and attempt to resist FEDRA's iron grip. The most prominent of these was the Fireflies who would base <br>
    their operations across the U.S in an attempt to subvert FEDRA's authority and restore a democratic sytem of government. <br>
    FEDRA would crack down hard on proclaimed "dissidents" with torture and public executions being common.
